All puzzles and art may not be representative of the final product

This demo consists of 14 puzzles.  You will be timed on how long it takes 
you to complete each level.

You may press escape at any time in a level to return to the world map.
Your time in that level will not be reset.  Please try to complete all levels
to the best of your abilities.

After you've completed all 14 puzzles, enter the portal at the north end
of the world map where you will be given a screen showing your complettion
times..  Please screenshot this screen and send it to captaincarrot#1312 on discord.

It is best if you complete this in one attempt and send me the information
for this first attempt.  It doesn't help me if you practice my puzzles a bunch
and then submit amazing times just to flex.

I am not looking for feedback about controls, art, puzzle variety,
jankiness, or much else at this time. Only completetion times for
the puzzles in this demo."
