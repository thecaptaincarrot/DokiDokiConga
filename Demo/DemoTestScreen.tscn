All puzzles and art may not be representative of the final product

This demo consists of 14 puzzles.  You will be timed on how long it takes 
you to complete each level.

After a minute, a button will appear to allow you to give up and move 
on to the next puzzle.  This does not actually give me much useful
information, so I'd encourage to not use it unless you're really stumped.
All puzzles have a solution

After you've completed all 14 puzzles, you will be presented with
an end screen with your times.  Please screenshot this screen and
send it to captaincarrot#1312 on discord for research purposes.

It is best if you complete this in one attempt and send me the information
for this first attempt.  It doesn't help me if you practice my puzzles a bunch
and then submit amazing times just to flex.

I am not looking for feedback about controls, art, puzzle variety,
jankiness, or much else at this time."
